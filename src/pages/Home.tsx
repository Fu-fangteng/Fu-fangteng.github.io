              <p>
                Hello! I'm Fangteng FU (or you can call me Magnus). I am now a
                Sophomore at HKUSTGZ who is intended to major in AI. I was once
                a summer researcher at CIS Lab, CMA Lab, HKUSTGZ and currently a
                Program Assistant at HKUSTGZ Library. Since I am not such a
                scholar now, this page is mainly used to demonstrate my
                projects, my current works and my future thoughts.

              <h2>üåç Early Life & Education</h2>
              <p>
                I was born and raised in Shenzhen, however, I would recognize
                myself as Haian people. I graduated from Shenzhen Experimental
                School (SZSY). I have always had a great love of science, and I
                am happy to go on a quest to understand how a matter works. I
                was fascinated by the rigor and precision of mathematical logic
                and formulas and theorems to make things work. I also love the
                arts, from poetry to street dance.

              <p>
                I aim to publish my own works in my junior year, consequently, I
                decided to gain as much experience in labs as possible when I am
                a sophomore. I am always willing to learn and to progress.
                Currently, I am equipped with the basic coding skills including
                python, c++, js, html and css. I have also finish courses like
                Honor Calculus and Applied Statistics and I also self-learn
                about the Data Structure and Algorithm.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, I am really interesting in AI and Data Science Field. If
                you are looking for enthusiasm UG student, I will be a good
                choice. It will be my great honor to hear from you.
